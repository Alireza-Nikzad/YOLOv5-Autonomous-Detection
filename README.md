# YOLOv5-Autonomous-Detection








This is my first object detection project using YOLOv5 â€” applied to a real road-driving video to simulate how autonomous vehicles detect their surroundings.

What this project does:

- Uses YOLOv5 for real-time object detection
- Detects cars, pedestrians, and other road objects
- Demonstrates how detection works in the context of autonomous driving
